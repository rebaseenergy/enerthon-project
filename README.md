This repo contains the optimization model which has been developed for Enerthon Nano Grid Home Challenge (https://www.enerthon.com/challenges)
The model is built in Pyomo (http://www.pyomo.org/) and co-optimizes and electricity and heat demand of a building in combination with PV generation, battery and thermal energy storage.
A linear programming solver needs to be installed for solving the model, e.g. GLPK (https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)
